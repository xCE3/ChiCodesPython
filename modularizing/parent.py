# test case How is this useful? We can use this conditional to prevent blocks of code from executing unless the file is being run directly. Why would we want to do this? Consider a situation where one class depends on another, as in the store and products assignments. In our product document we might create a lot of test code to make sure we can create new products and execute methods. When we import products to the store file as a module, we donâ€™t want to see all of those tests run every time we execute the store file, so inside of our product document, we might have something like below:
#   if __name__ == "__main__":
#     product = Product([args])
#     print(product)
#     print(product.add_tax(0.18))
